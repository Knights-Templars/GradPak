<h1>Data Reduction<a class="headerlink" href="#data-reduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The best way to reduce GradPak data is with IRAF and the <strong>dohydra</strong>
package. If you are unfamiliar with the basics of IRAF or the general order
IFU reductions with <strong>dohydra</strong> take solace in the fact that failure often
leads to deeper understanding and forge ahead.</p>
<p>From a high-level viewpoint reducing GradPak data is no different than
reducing any other IFU data, be it any of WIYN&#8217;s *Paks, Hydra, PPak,
etc. etc. However, the unique, multi-pitch nature of GradPak introduces some
interesting and frustrating complications that require special mention. In
this guide I will breeze through aspects of reduction that are common to all
IFUs and focus on the specificities of GradPak reductions.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Many of the concepts and steps mentioned below, while common to any
IFU reduction, are taken from the Disk Mass Survey&#8217;s SparsePak
reduction recipe (link soon). I highly recommend you read this
document at some point.</p>
</div>
<p>Below are the steps needed to go from raw frames from the bench to
flux-calibrated spectra ready for analysis. Steps in <em>italics</em> are
cruicially different for GradPak than any other IFU.</p>

<div class="section" id="basic-reductions">
<h2>1. Basic Reductions<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-reductions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first step is to prep your raw frames for <strong>dohydra</strong> this involves using
<strong>ccdproc</strong> to trim the images and do overscan, zero, and dark
corrections. You should also combine your flats (of the same exposure time)
and arc images to beat down the noise. At the end of this step you should have:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A single arc-lamp frame</li>
<li>A single dome flat frame for each exposure time taken</li>
<li>All of your program frames (object, standard stars, etc.) that have been
trimmed, overscan corrected, and zero and dark subtracted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick look at how I do this:</p>
<p>Overscan correct and trim <em>all</em> your images with <strong>ccdproc</strong> (make sure to
turn of the dark, bias, and flat corrections):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>ccdred&gt; ccdproc @all_my_files.lst @all_my_files_ot.lst overscan+ trim+ zerocor- darkcor- flatcor- illumco-
        biassec=image trimsec=image interact+ order=100
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then use imstat to identify any zero frames that have strangely large standard
deviations. Take these out of your master zero list. The combine all your
zeros into one master zero frame:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>ccdred&gt; imcombine @culled_zeros.lst Zero.fits combine=average reject=crreject
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now subtract this master zero from all other data:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>ccdred&gt; ccdproc @all_my_files_ot.lst overscan- trim- zerocor+ darkcor- flatcor- illumcor- zero=Zero.fits
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now combine all your zero corrected dark, arc, and flat frames using
<strong>imcombine</strong>. Remember to keep flats of different exposure times
separate. Finally, subtract your master dark from all of your data frames. You
do not need to worry about dark correcting your arc or flat frames because the
exposure times are so small and the signal is so high it really doesn&#8217;t
matter.</p>
<div class="section" id="scattered-light-corrections">
<h3>Scattered Light Corrections<a class="headerlink" href="#scattered-light-corrections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You probably will want to make some correction for light that gets scattered
from one aperture into another. IRAF does have a routine to do this
(<strong>noao.imred.hydra.apscatter</strong>), but in practice the very tight arrangement
of the GradPak slit renders it mostly useless. To deal with scattered light we
have taken a zeroth order approach (which, again, given the very tight
spacing, is the best we can do).</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="GradPak_scat.html#module-GradPak_scat" title="GradPak_scat"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">GradPak_scat</span></code></a> provides a simple method for subtracting scattered light
from GradPak data. We average all the flux in the &#8220;gutters&#8221; (regions on the
CCD that fall outside of the slit proper) of the CCD and perform a simple
linear interpolation across the slit to get an estimate for the scattered
light at each fiber location.</p>
<p>The idea behind this method is that the gutters contain only scattered light
from the end fibers and are therefore decent anchors for the ends of a
scattered light function. In the absense of any knowledge of how the scattered
light actually varies with position we assume a linear function and get on
with it. Quick and simple and probably not too bad. See <a class="reference internal" href="GradPak_scat.html#module-GradPak_scat" title="GradPak_scat"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">GradPak_scat</span></code></a>
for more details.</p>

<h2>2. <em>Prepare Master Flat</em><a class="headerlink" href="#prepare-master-flat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="options">
<h3>Options<a class="headerlink" href="#options" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you took flats at multiple exposures to get good signal across all fiber
sizes then this step is cruicial. If not, skip ahead to the next step.</p>
<p>This step will combine your multiple flats together into a single &#8216;master&#8217;
flat that can be used by <strong>dohydra</strong> to apply flat-field corrections to your
data. To do this we use <a class="reference internal" href="GradPak_flatfu.html#module-GradPak_flatfu" title="GradPak_flatfu"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">GradPak_flatfu</span></code></a>, which is pretty fancy.</p>
<p>See <a class="reference internal" href="GradPak_flatfu.html#module-GradPak_flatfu" title="GradPak_flatfu"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">GradPak_flatfu</span></code></a> for a detailed discussion of the method and options
available; the typical usage looks a lot like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>&gt; python GradPak_flatfu.py dFlat_4s.fits -t dFlat_1s.fits 43
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This example illustrates some important descisions you will have to make based
on a careful examination of your data. The first is where you want the pivot
point to be. In the above example I chose fiber 43 so that the 2&#8217;&#8217; and 3&#8217;&#8217;
fibers (1 - 43) will be taken from dFlat_4s.fits and the 4&#8217;&#8216;, 5&#8217;&#8216;, and 6&#8217;&#8217;
fibers (44 - 109) are taken from dFlat_1s.fits. This makes sense because in my
spectrograph setup the 4&#8217;&#8217; fibers are in the non-linear regime (don&#8217;t even ask
about the 5&#8217;&#8217; and 6&#8217;&#8217; fibers!) with a 4s dome flat exposure while the 2&#8217;&#8217; and
3&#8217;&#8217; fibers have dangerously low signal with a 1s exposure. This might not be
true for your data so make sure you choose a pivot point that works for you. I
cannot recommend pivoting around a fiber that is not at the border of two
fiber sizes.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">It is perfectly OK to have more than 2 different flat exposures (and
more than one pivot point). See <a class="reference internal" href="GradPak_flatfu.html#module-GradPak_flatfu" title="GradPak_flatfu"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">GradPak_flatfu</span></code></a> for more
information</p>
</div>
<p>The next thing you need to decide is which flat to use for doing the aperture
traces. Make sure it&#8217;s a good one because the resulting traces will be used
for <em>all</em> of your data (as they should be). By default, <em>GradPak_flatfu</em> will
use the first flat as the trace flat, but this is often non-ideal. In the
above example I used the <em>-t</em> flag to force <em>GradPak_flatfu</em> to use
dFlat_1s.fits as the trace flat. In my case I first tested the traces of each
flat and found that the 1s exposure flat produced trace fits that were cleaner
than the 4s flat, most likely due to the wonky shape of super-saturated larger
fibers. I highly recommend you do similar tests and decide for yourself which
flat produces better traces.</p>
<p>Next, you have the option of specifying a <em>throughput</em> image that is used to
make fiber-to-fiber corrections after extraction. Basically what IRAF does is
extract the throughput image, sum each fiber along the dispersion axis, and
apply a correction to normalize these sums. I strongly recommend <strong>NOT</strong>
applying this correction because:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Because of the multiple fiber sizes in GradPak this will, in principle,
take your measured surface brightnesses and turn them into total intensity,
which might confuse you later when you wonder why some fibers are way
brighter than others.</li>
<li>IRAF doesn&#8217;t even do step 1. right. Because of some rigidity in the way
aperture traces are computed there will not be the simple (2:3:4:5:6)^2
ratio in brightness you might expect from the fiber sizes.</li>
<li>Any variation in the throughputs of the fibers should already be captured
and corrected by the dome flats. GradPak is small enough on the sky the the
WIYN flat lamps should do a pretty darn good job approximating uniform
illumination. Are you <em>sure</em> you want to use a throughput image?</li>
</ol>
<p>All that said, if you <em>really</em> want to use a throughput image just precede it
with the <em>-r</em> option.</p>
<p>Finally, you have a choice to remove the average flat spectrum from the master
flat. This option is on by default. If selected each spectral channel of the
master flat is divided by the average of that channel over all fibers. Because
GradPak has multiple fiber sizes this step will not completely eliminate the
spectral signature of the flat lamps, but it will greatly decrease it. At the
end of the day this option is largely a matter of preference because flux
calibration will remove the average flat spectrum anyway. If you want to keep
the average flat spectrum for whatever reason you can turn off this option
with the <em>-nf</em> option.</p>

<h3>Setting up <strong>dohydra</strong> parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-dohydra-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

dependent on the parameters you set for <em>HYDRA</em> and <strong>dohydra</strong> in IRAF. To
access the global <em>HYDRA</em> parameters make sure you&#8217;ve loaded the <em>HYDRA</em>
package and type:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>hydra&gt; epar params
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Many of these can be left as the default, but pay special attention to the
TRACE PARAMETERS and ARC DISPERSION FUNCTION PARAMETERS. You can change these
interactively as you fit, but after a few iterations you can save yourself
some keystrokes by setting the defaults here. More important are the
<strong>dohydra</strong> parameters:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>hydra&gt; epar dohydra
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Leave the first section blank for now (it will be filled in by
<a class="reference internal" href="GradPak_flatfu.html#module-GradPak_flatfu" title="GradPak_flatfu"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">GradPak_flatfu</span></code></a>). Make sure your readnoise and gain are correct (this
info is in the FITS header). <em>Fibers</em> should be 109 and make sure <em>apidtab =
gradpak_sizes.iraf</em> (this is crucial for proper sky subtraction).</p>
<p>The <em>width</em> parameter is very important for aperture extraction. Before you
set this open up one of your flat images (preferably the one that will be
traced) with <strong>implot</strong> or <strong>imexam</strong> and measure the width of the 6&#8217;&#8217; fibers
(along the spatial dimension). These fibers probably won&#8217;t have gaussian
profiles, but use the FWHM provided and your best judgement to determine an
appropriate <em>width</em> value.</p>

<p>From a user perspective, running <a class="reference internal" href="GradPak_flatfu.html#module-GradPak_flatfu" title="GradPak_flatfu"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">GradPak_flatfu</span></code></a> is identical to using
the aperture identification and extraction parameters in the <em>HYDRA</em>
package. The first step is to identify all 109 GradPak apertures. I have never
had to adjust the aperture locations presented by IRAF, so if you find
yourself doing this you probably have some parameters set to wonky
values. Make sure you get all the way to 109 on the right side and that the
visible, but obviously broken fiber falls between 58 and 59.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Example of aperture identification. Your plot should not look very different from this.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The next step is to fit the aperture traces. I was fortunate enough to have a
spectragraph setup that made this process a real pain in the ass, but maybe it
will be really easy for you. The end goal is to give each aperture a trace
that fits the data reasonably well. For me this meant going through all 109
apertures and adjusting the fit parameters manually to get good fits and
consistent end behavior. That last point is an important one; if you have low
signal at one end of your spectrum (probably the blue) you might find that the
same fit parameters cause one aperture to swing wildly up at this end while
the next aperture swingly wildly down. This doesn&#8217;t really make physical sense
and should be avoided.</p>

</div>
<p>Even if you get lucky and can fit all your apertures well with the same fit
parameters I highly recommend monitoring the fits of all apertures at least
once before you push that big &#8216;NO&#8217; button.</p>
<p>Once all the aperture tracing is done you&#8217;ll see a few messages about

aperture traces, wavelength solutions, etc. This defaults to a

mess up some aperture traces you&#8217;ll have to delete the

<h2>3. Run <strong>dohydra</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#run-dohydra" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After all your hard work running <a class="reference internal" href="GradPak_flatfu.html#module-GradPak_flatfu" title="GradPak_flatfu"><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">GradPak_flatfu</span></code></a> <strong>dohydra</strong> essentially
becomes a wavelength solution tool. It is important when you run <strong>dohydra</strong>
to not change any parameters except <em>objects</em> and <em>arcs1</em>. <em>Objects</em> will
probably be a file containing all your science frames (objects, standard
stars, etc.) and <em>arcs1</em> should be the combined arc lamp spectrum you made all
the way back in step 1. You can set these using epar, but I like to just call
them directly:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>hydra&gt; dohydra @pointings.lst arcs1=Comp.fits
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The first thing you will see is the spectrum of your arc lamp. I will probably
be flipped in wavelenght (red on the left), but a quick &#8216;w&#8217;, &#8216;f&#8217; will fix that
problem. Your first task is to identify 4 or 5 emission lines that you know
the wavelengths of. The NOAO Arc Line atlas is a good place to go if you are
unsure, but hopefully you figured out a few when you were setting up the
spectrograph. Place your cursor over the lines, hit the &#8216;m&#8217; key to mark them
and then enter the wavelegnth. Once you&#8217;re done you should have something that
looks like this.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id3">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/dohydra1.png"><img alt="marking initial emission lines" src="_images/dohydra1.png" style="width: 642px; height: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Example of marking initial set of 4-5 arc emission lines. Make sure you
get these right.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Now tell <strong>dohydra</strong> to fit a solution and refine it with more lines. The
first part is achieved by pressing &#8216;f&#8217; to enter <strong>icfit</strong>, IRAF&#8217;s interactive
curve fitter. At this point the RMS should be very low because you only have a
few points, so you&#8217;ll probably just hit &#8216;q&#8217; to exit the curve fitter right
away.</p>
<p>Now press &#8216;l&#8217; to load in more lines from a line list. This is where the fun
begins. You will now jump back and forth between fitting (with &#8216;f&#8217;) and
managing lines. The RMS that indicates a &#8220;good&#8221; fit varies depending on the
spectrograph setup, but in general you want to eliminate and low-order trends
in your residuals. The figure below shows a pretty decent fit.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id4">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/dohydra2.png"><img alt="a decent wavelength solution" src="_images/dohydra2.png" style="width: 642px; height: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">A wavelength solution after fitting and grooming the arc lines.</span></p>
</div>
<p><strong>THIS PART IS IMPORTANT</strong> With the large fibers on GradPak it is very common
to have some arc lines that are way oversaturated and it is imperitive that
you remove these from your wavelength solution. Usually they will be obvious
in the residual plot, but this shouldn&#8217;t stop you from, at least once,
manually looking at a zoom-in of every single line begin used in the
fit. Another trick that GradPak plays is that the initial fit is done on the
central fiber, which is 4&#8217;&#8216;. It is likely that some lines that are close
together but perfectly distinct with 4&#8217;&#8217; fibers are a gross blend in the 6&#8217;&#8217;
fibers. When you are marking and checking lines it is a good idea to look at
the extracted 2D spectrum (.ms.fits file) and pay attention to which lines
get blended in the large fibers.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id5">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/arc_warning.png"><img alt="look out for lines that blend in larger fibers" src="_images/arc_warning.png" style="width: 667px; height: 488px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">An example of the perils of large fibers. The two marked arc lines would
appear to be great candidates for a wavelength solution in smaller fibers,
but they should be deleted from the fit because they will be very messy in
the largest fibers.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve got your fit all figured out hit &#8216;q&#8217; until IRAF asks you if you
want to fit the next aperture interactively. It is generally a good idea to
review each fit at least once to make sure there are no blended lines messing
with your solution. If there are certain lines that keep causing problems it
might be worth it to start the whole process again (see note below). Once
you&#8217;re satisfied that your fit is legit for all apertures you can finish the
<strong>dohydra</strong> run. Depending on how you&#8217;ve setup <strong>dohydra</strong> you might have to
linearize your data separately. This is done with <strong>dispcor</strong> and is really
easy:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>hydra&gt; dispcor @pointings.ms.lst @pointings.ms_lin.lst w1=WAVE1 w2=WAVE2 dw=CDELT1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to specify the exact solution (w1, w1, and dw), but it can be
nice to have all of your data from different nights on exactly the same
wavelength grid.</p>
<p>All done! You should now have a bunch of *.ms_lin.fits files ready for sky
subtraction and flux calibration.</p>

<h2>5. Flux Calibration<a class="headerlink" href="#flux-calibration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At this point you&#8217;re basically back on the standard multispec reduction path
so I won&#8217;t go into a ton of detail, but the main steps are outlined below. All
of these IRAF tasks live in the <em>NOAO.ONEDSPEC</em> package.</p>
<div class="section" id="airmass-correction">
<h3>Airmass Correction<a class="headerlink" href="#airmass-correction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to know the atmospheric extinction to each of your
frames. Fortunately the FITS headers have just about everything you
need. <strong>setairmass</strong> does the rest:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>onedspec&gt; setairmass @airmass.lst
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Where airmass.lst is a list of all your standard stars and sky-subtracted
object frames. There are now parameters worth mentioning.</p>

<div class="section" id="standard-star-comparison">
<h3>Standard Star Comparison<a class="headerlink" href="#standard-star-comparison" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This step takes your standard star spectra, bins them to equal the same
resolution of the library spectrum, and then computes the difference between
the two. There are a few important parameters:</p>
<table class="docutils field-list" frame="void" rules="none">
<col class="field-name" />
<col class="field-body" />
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="field-odd field"><th class="field-name">extinct:</th><td class="field-body">This is a file that contains extinction information for KPNO. If you
did a good job with your standard star observations you&#8217;ll be given
an opportunity to update this information, but the defualt file does
a pretty damn good job. The default is <em>onedstds$kpnoextinct.dat</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="field-even field"><th class="field-name">caldir:</th><td class="field-body">The location of the standard star reference library. Depending on
what stars you used you&#8217;ll have a few options of libraries to
use. All live in the <em>onedstds</em> directory. On the UW Astro computers
this is <em>/iraf/iraf/noao/lib/onedstds</em>. Look in the directories
within to find your star. IRAF has a description of where each
library comes from, but I think <em>onedstds$spec50cal</em> is probably the
best.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field-odd field"><th class="field-name">star_nam:</th><td class="field-body">Hopefully it is obvious why this parameter is important. Data for
this star must live in the directory specified above and must have
an entry in the <em>names.men</em> file in that directory.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For each standard star observation you only have one fiber illuminated so
you&#8217;ll specify the aperture number why you call <strong>standard</strong>. Typically:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>onedspec&gt; standard BD284211_171_ot.ms_lin.fits std aperture=107 star_name=bd284211

</div>
<div class="section" id="sensitivity-function">
<h3>Sensitivity Function<a class="headerlink" href="#sensitivity-function" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The IRAF task <strong>sensfun</strong> takes all your standard star observations and
computes a wavelength and airmass dependent sensitivity response function for
your instrument. The important gotchas are:</p>
<table class="docutils field-list" frame="void" rules="none">
<col class="field-name" />
<col class="field-body" />
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="field-odd field"><th class="field-name">extinct:</th><td class="field-body">Set this to be exactly the same as in <strong>standard</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="field-even field"><th class="field-name">newexti:</th><td class="field-body">If you&#8217;ve got enough data to compute an extinction correction the
new, corrected extinction will be written to this file.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The other parameters can be set during fitting.</p>
<p>In a basic sense using <strong>sensfun</strong> is like any interactive curve fitting in
IRAF; change the order and func until you are happy that the residuals have as
little structure as possible. The one extra thing you can do is try fitting an
extinction correction. For this you need to have standard star observations
taken over a large range of airmasses, but if you do just hit &#8216;e&#8217; and do some
more fitting. When you&#8217;re done the program will tell you if your correction
makes a significant difference to the sensitivity function fit. If you choose
to save the new extinction data then it will be written to the file specified
above.</p>

<div class="section" id="calibration">
<h3>Calibration<a class="headerlink" href="#calibration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This step is really easy. The one thing to watch out for is the setting for

otherwise keep it as <em>onedstds$kpnoextinct.dat</em>. The rest is really easy:</p>

<h2>A Note About Errors<a class="headerlink" href="#a-note-about-errors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having error vectors to go along with your reduced spectra feels great and
there is no reason why you should not have them. There are two ways that I
have so far used to to get errors, both working best in different cases.</p>
<div class="section" id="full-error-propagation">
<h3>Full Error Propagation<a class="headerlink" href="#full-error-propagation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Full propagation of the errors is the way to go if you do not have a lot of
frames of the same sky location. This method starts from photon counting
statistics and propagates these uncertainties through the entire reduction
pipline. A few assumptions are made that affect accuracy for the sake of
simplicity, but all in all this method works well and will give you good error
estimates.</p>
<p>If you are using this method you will combine all of your data frames
after basic reductions, but before you jump into any HYDRA functions
(step 2). Then, at the end of all the reduction use mab&#8217;s <strong>rawimerr</strong>
(see the SparsePak reduction guide) to get a sigma image:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">ifupkg</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">rawimerr</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">INGC_891_P2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fits</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">o44</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">b25</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">nim7</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and propagate this image through the GradPak pipline:</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="multi-frame-error-estimates">
<h3>Multi-Frame Error Estimates<a class="headerlink" href="#multi-frame-error-estimates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you have a statistically sufficient number of single frames for each
pointing/object/sky position/whatever then you can take a shortcut in the
error calculations. All you do is reduce each frame separately (i.e., don&#8217;t
combine individual frames before reduction) and only combine them into a
single frame after all other reduction steps are completed. The standard
deviation of this combination is then an accurate estimate of the
uncertainties on each wavelength channel.</p>
<p>This method is only valid when there were no changes to the
telescope/instrument system between each frame. In other words, you have to be
sure that each individual frame is just a different sample of the same
underlying photon distribution. If this is true then in some ways a
multi-frame error estimation can be more &#8220;correct&#8221; than full error
propagation because it inherently includes envirornmental factors like
transparency and seeing variations; a full propagation assumes no difference
to the <em>detector input</em> while a multi-frame estimate accepts that this input
might be perturbed from its &#8220;true&#8221; value by stochastic variations in the
entire system.</p>
<p>One last benefit of a multi-frame error estimation is that it easily
accomidates the same sky position observed over multiple nights.</p>
<p>But enough philosophy, how do you actually get errors for this method?  In
it&#8217;s most basic form all you do is average your individual frames together to
get the final data spectra and take the standard deviation to get the error
spectra, but we can do better! Not all frames are created equal so a weighted
average is often better. For weights I use the w = 1/snr^2, where &#8220;snr&#8221;
comes from <strong>imexam</strong>&#8216;s &#8216;m&#8217; key in a flat part of a sky fiber (use the same
fiber for all frames). <strong>imcombine</strong> takes care of the rest:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>onedspec&gt; imcombine @combine.lst NGC_891_P3.ms_rfs_lin.fits
          sigma=NGC_891_P3.me_rfs_lin.fits combine=average reject=sigclip
          weight=@ind-all-rf-P3_weights.lst scale=@ind-all-rf-P3_scales.lst
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A few notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>You can set <em>combine=median</em> if you want, but if, after all the
reduction steps, you still have outlying pixels then something
might be wrong.</li>
<li><em>reject=sigclip</em> is somewhat important. Don&#8217;t use &#8216;avsigclip&#8217;
because, after all that reduction, your pixel values no longer
follow poisson statistics</li>
<li>In the above example I used the <em>scale</em> keyword to remove the
impact of some (grey) cirrus clouds that I know intruded on a
subset of data frames. You might not need this.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The last step is to take your <em>sigma</em> image, which is simply the standard
deviation and turn it into a measure of the <em>standard error</em>, which is what we
really care about. Simply divide by the square root of the number of frames,
so if we had, for example, 11 frames the call would be:</p>
